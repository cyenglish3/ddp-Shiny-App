# ddp-Shiny-App
==================================

This repo contains the supporting documentation and files for a simple shiny app developed for Developing Data Products, a Coursera course under the Data Science Specialization. The app is a simple calculator. It allows a front-end user to perform a simple calculation - to include percentage and sqaure root - with user-entered values by pressing the 'CALCULATE' button in the left navigation panel.  This repo contains the following additional files:

1. ui.R used to generate the shiny app
2. server.R second file needed to generate the shiny app
3. ddpCalculator.md is the Markdown file that generates the R Presenter presentation describing the shiny app
4. ddpCalculator.html is a HTML compiled from the .md file, and generates the presentation, which is here. It could not be uploaded to RPubs.
