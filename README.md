# ddp-Shiny-App
==================================

This repo contains the supporting documentation and files for a simple shiny app developed for Developing Data Products, a Coursera course under the Data Science Specialization. The app is based on a climate data set obtained from: Computing for Data Analysis.  The app itself takes allows the user to input specifics about the climate and obtain an estimated temperature based on a GLM prediction algorithm generated from the original data set.  Users can pick ozone, solar.r, wind, month and day attributes.  Once they hit submit, the app returns a forecasted temperature.  This repo contains the following additional files:

1. ui.R used to generate the shiny app
2. server.R second file needed to generate the shiny app
3. ddpClimate.md is the Markdown file that generates the R Presenter presentation describing the shiny app
4. ddpClimate.html is a HTML compiled from the .md file, and generates the presentation, which is here. It could not be uploaded to RPubs.
